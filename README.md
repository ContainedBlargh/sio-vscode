# SIO - VSCode Extension

This extension adds syntax highlighting for the [SIO programming language](https://github.com/containedblargh/sio) to VSCode, based on the [excellent template](https://github.com/semanticart/minimum-viable-vscode-language-server-extension/) provided by [`semanticart`](https://github.com/semanticart).
